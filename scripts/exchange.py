    # The STokenERC20 contract does not conform to the ERC20 standard and revert in the `transferFrom()`
    # function if the `from` address does not have sufficient tokens and if the `to` address doesn't
    # have a sufficient allowance. Instead the function returns false. This means that an attacker can
    # call `enter()` in the exchange with an arbitrary amount as the parameter and his account will get
    # credited that amount on the exchange eventhough he never had any tokens and the `transferFrom()`
    # function 'failed'. The attacker can then call `exit()` and drain ETH from the exchange, due to
    # their account being credited as many fake tokens as they specified. The exchange should have checked
    # the return value from the `transferFrom()` function and handled the failure itself instead of assuming
    # the function would revert on failure.
