    # exploit
    # The vulnerability is in the `onlyAuth()` modifier. The modifier checks that
    # msg.sender is either the owner or the contract itself. If an attacker can
    # make the contract call itself with the right calldata, they can make the
    # contract call its own `changeOwner()` function, which has the modifier,
    # and the function will execute sussesfully since the contract is calling
    # itself. The `staticall()` function in the contract allows for this capability.
    # The `staticall()` function will perform a low level call to the target address
    # and send it the calldata that was provided in the payload parameter. An attacker
    # can encode the calldata requried to call the `changeOwner()` function with their
    # address as the parameter and call the `staticall()` function with their malicious
    # calldata and the contract itself as the target parameter. This will result in the
    # contract calling itself with the maliciious calldata, which will lead to the attacker
    # becoming the new owner of the contract. The owner can then call the priviledged
    # `withdrawAll()` function and drain the ETH from the contract.
